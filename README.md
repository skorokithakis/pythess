pythess
=======

Yet another Django website for a local Python meetup, because apparently every city needs one. This one's for Thessaloniki, where we gather monthly to pretend we understand decorators.

## Running locally

If you really must:

```bash
uv sync              # because pip wasn't enterprise enough
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8000 to see a website that could have been a Google Calendar invite.

## Features we're definitely proud of

- Speaker bios auto-generated by AI (`./manage.py fill_out_bios`), because nothing says "we value our speakers" like having a robot write about them
- Static site generation that creates 500 HTML files for 12 events
- Events named after Greek dishes, which started as a joke and now we're stuck with it
- A presentations archive that proves yes, someone did give a talk about Excel automation in 2019 and we all had to sit through it
- An RSS feed of meetups at `/feed/`, for those who'd rather subscribe than talk to us
